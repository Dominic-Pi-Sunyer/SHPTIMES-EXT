SHP TIMES

SHP times is an extension that uses Kevin Morrisâ€™s cs.shschools.org for the bell times and uses a table that was published by the cafeteria. This is a passion project and might not be 100% accurate all the time and might have bugs. If you find any bugs please tell me (dpisunyer27@gmail.com). If you have any ideas or want to contribute please tell me or use GitHub. I hope this helps you stay on time. Enjoy using it.

Thanks,
Dominic
